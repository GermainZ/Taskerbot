Taskerbot
=========

A reddit bot to make moderation easier, especially on mobile.

Its main goal is to allow mods to remove posts while leaving removal reasons
via the bot.

Usage
=====

Taskerbot can be invoked by any comment or moderator report containing one of
the following commands (you can either use `!` or `@`):

- ``!rule {reason} [note]``: **removes a thread, leaving an appropriate flair
  and comment**. ``reason`` is one of the removal reasons' keys (see `Removal
  reasons`_). If no corresponding removal reason is found, the ``Generic``
  reason is used instead. If ``note`` is provided, it will be added to the
  message.

  Example: ``!rule 1``, ``!rule spam``, ``!rule repost this is a note``.

- ``!spam``: **marks the submission as spam and removes it**.

- ``!ban [duration] "{reason}" "{message}"``: **bans the comment/thread's
  author**. The last two arguments are required. ``duration``, if provided, is
  the ban's duration in days, ``reason`` is the ban's reason (visible only to
  mods), and ``message`` is the message the banned user will receive. ``reason``
  and ``message`` must be between quotations (``""```) (escapes are not supported).

  Example: ``!ban 3600 "spammer" "repeatedly spamming somedomain.com"``

Multiple actions can be specified at once. If Taskerbot was invoked by a
comment (as opposed to a moderator report), it will automatically remove it.

- **Refreshing the list of moderators/removal reasons**:

  Taskerbot loads the subreddit's list of moderators and removal reasons at
  startup. To refresh these, send Taskerbot a message containing ``!refresh
  Subreddit`` (e.g. ``!refresh Android`` to reload ``/r/Android``'s
  configuration).

  Note that this is case sensitive, so make sure it's the same as what's in the
  configuration file (see `Configuration file`_).

Only moderator reports and comments made by/mails sent by the subreddit's
moderators are checked.

PS. Reddit silently ignores reports on removed posts, so Taskerbot won't see
those.

Setup
=====

Dependencies
------------

Taskerbot requires Python 3. For a list of required Python 3 libraries, see
``requirements.txt``.

The required Heroku__ files are provided with this project if you're interested
in running it on a Heroku app. For example (after setup):

.. code:: py

   heroku ps:scale bot=1 --app app-name-here

__ https://heroku.com/

Requirements
------------

``/u/Taskerbot`` doesn't accept new additions as we want to keep an acceptable
load. That being said, you're free to run your own instance.

You'll first want to create a new account and make it a mod of your subreddit.
Required permissions are: access, flair, posts, and wiki.

Configuration
-------------

Taskerbot uses `YAML`_ for its configuration files. You can find a good
document covering the syntax here__.

__ https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html

.. _Configuration file:

Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``config.yaml`` file must contain the bot's username, password and a list
of subreddits to patrol. The syntax is as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   User Agent: 'user agent here'
   Client ID: 'client id here'
   Client Secret: 'client secret here'
   Username: 'bot username here'
   Password: 'bot password here'
   Subreddits:
       - 'SomeSubreddit'
       - 'AnotherSubreddit'
       - 'YetAnotherSub'

To obtain the client ID and secret, please follow reddit's `OAuth2 First Steps
guide`_.

Use a `YAML validator`_ to make sure the configuration file is valid.

.. _Removal reasons:

Removal reasons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step must be performed for every new subreddit you want Taskerbot to
patrol.

1. Create a new wiki page on the subreddit called ``taskerbot``.
   For example, if you want Taskerbot to patrol ``/r/Android``, you must create
   ``/r/Android/wiki/taskerbot``.
2. Fill the page with the reasons you want -- ``Header``, ``Footer`` and
   ``Generic`` are required reasons so make sure you include at least those:

   .. code:: yaml

      Header: "Sorry {author}, your submission has been removed:"

      Footer: "If you would like to appeal, please message the moderators. *I am a bot, but this message was generated at the instruction of a human moderator.*"

      'Generic':

          Flair: 'Removed'

          Message: |
              Please review our sidebar for the complete list of rules.

      '1':

          Flair: "Removed (Rule 1)"

          Message: |
              Sorry, your post was removed as it breaks rule 1!
              Check our wiki for more info.

      '2':

          Flair: "Removed (Rule 2)"

          Message: |
              Sorry, your post was removed as it breaks rule 2!
              Check our wiki for more info.

              Also consider checking some of our sister subreddits if you want to
              do XYZ:

              - /r/SomeSubreddit - for X.
              - /r/SomeOtherSubreddit - for Y.
              - /r/YetAnotherSubreddit - for Z.

      'spam':

          Flair: "Removed (Spam)"

          Message: |
              Sorry, your post was removed as we don't like spam!
              Check our wiki for more info.

   **Reasons' keys cannot contain spaces** (e.g. in the example above, ``1``
   and ``spam`` are fine, but ``reason 2`` is not).

   Each custom removal reason must have two entries: ``Flair``, which will be
   what the removed thread's flair is set to, and ``Message``, which is the
   comment Taskerbot will leave in the thread.

   Also note that Taskerbot will automatically replace all instances of
   ``{author}`` in the ``Header`` and ``Footer`` with the author's username.

   You can check `/r/Android's taskerbot wiki page`__ for a real example (click
   "View source" in the bottom right).

   __ https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/wiki/taskerbot
3. Create a new wiki page on the subreddit called ``taskerbot_logs``. You can
   keep it blank (Taskerbot will always append to it). This page will be used
   to log mod actions.

PS. Make sure to make the wiki pages editable by mods only.

Use a `YAML validator`_ to make sure the configuration file is valid.
